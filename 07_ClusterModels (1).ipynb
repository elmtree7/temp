Some links to quick-start guides and tutorials are provided here. Please ask you instructional staff if you have additional questions or difficulties using these packages.     \n",
        "> 1. The [Scikit-Learn package](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is a core machine learning package. You can find a quick-start guide for Scikit-Learn [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html). An overview of [applying Scikit-Learn for clustering models](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html) is provided under the unsupervised learning documentation.   \n",
        "> 2. The [Seaborn package](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html#) is a powerful data visualization package. You can find a quick-start guide to Seaborn [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html). Seaborn provides uses with many examples and [tutorials](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html) on each category of charts provided.  \n",
        "> 3. THe Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection or [UMAP package](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allows  visualization of high-dimensional data on a 2-dimensional **manifold**. You can find installation instructions for this package [here](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). We will discuss manifold learning in the dimensionality reduction lesson. For the current version of the umap package it is recommend that you also install the umap-learn package by uncommetting and running the code below:\n",

        "**Clustering models** are core data mining methods. Clustering models are also known as **unsupervised learning** models. The goal of these models is to extract structure and relationships from complex data. Carrying out this type of exploration is difficult since there is no ground truth as a basis of comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment you will work with a complex human resources data set to explore the basic concepts of clustering. Specifically, you will use the [human resources (HR) dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jacksonchou/hr-analytics). The business goal is to discover attributes common to employees who leave a large company prematurely. You will use multiple clustering algorithms to build an understanding of the relationships between the variables. Since we do not know in advance which attributes are important in an employees decision to leave, this is a perfect application for clustering methods.   \n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluation of any unsupervised learning model is a difficult task at the best of times. In this assignment you will use a combination of numeric and graphical evaluation methods. The scope of model evaluation and comparison has deliberately been limited here. Many more methods can and should be applied to complex real-world problems. Regardless of the evaluation methods applied, interpretation of clustering model results remains difficult and requires judgment.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you proceed with the exercises, keep in mind that the relationships in this data set are complex. There are unlikely to be one or just a few simple reasons why long-term employees chooses to leave their jobs. Consequently, you should not expect simple well defined results for any analytical model. This type of difficulty and complexity is inherent in many real-world applications of unsupervised learning.    \n",
        "\n",
        "The cluster models you will apply in this assignment have many hyperparameters. To limit the scope of the exercises, values for many hyperparameters are specified in many cases. These values were found by limited exploration of the hyperparameter space. For a real-world project a great deal more time-consuming exploration would be required.\n",

Notice that the difference in numerical value of these two peaks is quite small. The Calinski-Harabasz index has one distinct peak at $k=4$, but nearly the same value at $k=5$ The question is, where is the best cutoff that leads to an informative, but not over-fit model?

        "\n",
        "**K-mediods** algorithms extend the general ideas of k-means to non-Euclidean spaces. The k-means algorithm specifically requires the ability to complete a centroid or multi-variate mean for each clusters. Since, the multi-variate mean is only defined in Eucledian spaces, it is impossible to extend k-means algorithms to non-Eucledian spaces. The k-metriods algorithms overcome this difficulty by using mediods as cluster centers. In simple terms, a mediod is a sample that serves as the ceneter of a cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "A mediod of cluster $C_i$, $s_m$ is the sample that minimizes the sum of the distance metric, or **deviation**, $d(s_m,s_j)$ to all other samples in the cluster $s_{j \\in C_i, j \\ne m}$:\n",

There are no known polynomial time algorithms for such problems. A brute-force approach of enumerating all possible [combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) is feasible for only very small numbers of samples. Therefor, we must rely on a good **heuristic** to find an approximate solution. Because of its importance in unsuppervised learning there has been considerable research into find accurate and fast heuristic algorithms for the k-metriod problem. It is important to keep in mind that all such heuristic solutions are an approximation at best.   \n",
        "\n",
        "There are two different approaches that are widely used. The original **partioning around mediods or PAM** algorithm of [Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990](https://www.scirp.org/(S(czeh2tfqyw2orz553k1w0r45))/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=1771062) uses two steps:   \n",
        "1. The BUILD step finds the $k$ initial metriods. A first mediod is found by globally minimizing the deviation on a single mediod. The additional $k-1$ metriods are then found sequentially by minimizing TD for each addition. This algorithm is greedy, as it reduces TD by the maximum at each step. However, there is no guarantee that TD is minimized globally.     \n",
        "2. The SWAP or exchange step then tests other samples as potential mediods. Each of the samples becomes a candidate mediod, and TD is computed. If this exchange of mediods reduces TD the new metriod assigment is retained. The SWAP steps are repeated until no significant improvement in TD is found. Once again, this is a greedy algorithm with no guarantee of finding the globally optimal solution.      \n",
        "\n",
        "The PAM algorithm can be effective, but has poor scalability with complexity of $O(n^2k)$ once caching of intermediate results is employed in the SWAP step. As a result of the poor scalability, there is ongoing research into more efficient k-metriods algorithms. A recent review of this work can be found in [Schubert and Rousseuw, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437921000557?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=7ce03f30a8332f02).\n",

CLARA has compuational efficience of approximately $O(k^3 + n)$. Thus, CLARA is scalable to large numbers of samples, $n$, as long as the number of required clusters, $k$, is fairly small. Further, variations of CLARA allow the independent samples be processed in parallel.       "

Samples in the dense core of the clusters are connected by undirected edges. Samples on the periphery of the clusters are corrected by directed edges. Samples too far from any cluster are unconnected to any cluster. Unlike the other models you have worked with in this assignment, OPTICS does not require the specification of the number of clusters.
